# Hosting of the bot and next steps
The solution we have shown this time around is just a simple version for inspirational/educational purposes. It runs on localhost and has some very simple error log parsing. The next step from here could be to host it on a serverless platform like Vercel for a more convenient uptime, expanding error log parsing to contain file location, or prompt engineering GPT to provide further details and possibly even solutions to errors.
